            I     learnt   a   new   way   to   approach   the   percentage   problems.


           
            Aptitude   test   is   a   way   of   testing   candidates    mental    ability.

           
            When   the   selling   prices   are same and the loss and profit  then the result
           
            is   always   loss%=((x)<sub>2</sub>/100)%
