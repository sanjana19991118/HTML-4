       <h1>THE BOOK HOUSE</h1>
        <p>
        On a Tuesday around 12:30 PM, you might find me in what I call the “secret” Strand, a little bookstore nested like a Russian doll behind the Putnam & Putnam flower shop behind the Toby’s Estate Coffee inside the Club Monaco flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. If the main Strand (12th and Broadway) boasts “18 miles of books,” this speakeasy of a branch offers about a hundred meters worth, a mere dash. I often retreat there on my lunch break for a midday hideaway and a reprieve from the screens and stress of the office.

        A chameleon, a bookstore can be a theater, a gallery, a workspace, a gift shop, a landmark, a safe haven, an oasis. A bookstore is always, I think, a place of worship. Devotees show respect and reverence: for each other, for the texts, for the space, for the fact that reading is sacred in its silence. Believers—in the awesome, transformative power of words—gather to study and introspect and discover. Squint and you could imagine customers as congregants, eyes on the page, minds in the sky, praying separately, together. The experience is collective and also deeply personal, almost spiritual.
        
        Sometimes I’ll visit Spoonbill & Sugartown in Williamsburg or the new Rizzoli in Flatiron (dubbed “the most beautiful bookstore in New York”), browsing from cover to cover, each one an entranceway, a portal to an undiscovered elsewhere. I’ll meander through, touching everything, like a six-year-old in a toy store, hoping to absorb knowledge or inspiration through some miracle of osmosis.

        I’ve beheld a certain kind of magic, no doubt. One time I was transfixed by a butterfly that had mysteriously found its way into the basement of McNally Jackson Books in SoHo. The pitiful thing was struggling; unable to elevate, it could only leap about a foot above the floor before finding itself grounded. I watched as it hopped desperately around the stacks, then towards me, and then directly onto my left shoe where it sat, exhausted. After a few submitted moments, the butterfly, in a miraculous display of spirit and strength, fluttered upwards—six, seven feet into the air—flapped its wings triumphantly, circumnavigated the entire sports section, and landed again, this time on my right shoe. After a full minute of stillness, the butterfly hopped onto to the floor, and we went our separate ways.
